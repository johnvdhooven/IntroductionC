\section secImplGuidelines Guidelines

Guidelines for managing complexity:

- implement every subsystem in a separate C module.
- naming convention: use the name of the subsystem for the name of the C module.
- a C module consist of at least one header .h file and a related implementation .c file.

The Hardware IO in the *HAL* layer is not implemented.
IO is simulated.
