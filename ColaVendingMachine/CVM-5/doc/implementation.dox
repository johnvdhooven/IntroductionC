\section secImplGuidelines Guidelines

Guidelines for managing complexity and improving readability:

- implement every subsystem in a separate C module (software component).
- a C module consist of at least one header .h file and a related implementation .c file.
- naming convention: use the name of the subsystem for the name of the C module.
- the names of the device API functions should be prefixed by an abbreviation 
  of the device name.
- the Hardware IO in the *HAL* layer is not implemented. IO is simulated.
- implement the [Display Simulation] and [Keyboard Simulation] 
  in the modules [Display] and [Keyboard].
